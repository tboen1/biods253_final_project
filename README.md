## Wordle Solver

This codebase helps you make intelligent guesses when playing wordle, using ideas from information theory! 

### User Guide

The main program in this codebase is `wordle_solver.py`. This program helps you make intelligent guesses,
and comes with the followig arguments. 

- `--board`: this flag allows you to enter the current state of your game as a sequence of guesses and outputs. This sequence can be empty, if you're starting without a guess, or it can be as many pairs of guesses and outputs as  needed. To enter an output, please use the following convention: 

  ðŸŸ© = `"G"`, ðŸŸ¨ = `"Y"`, and â¬œ = `"X"`. 

  For example, if you guessed "crane" and saw â¬œ â¬œ ðŸŸ© â¬œ ðŸŸ©, and then "cloud" and saw â¬œ ðŸŸ© â¬œ â¬œ ðŸŸ¨, you'd enter `--board "crane" "XXGXG" "cloud" "XGXXY"`. 

  This is an optional flag! If you'd like to start a wordle game from scratch we'll happily provide you with a first guess. For mathematical reasons, we really like the word "raise" :)

### Examples

For example, let's say that you guessed "crane" and saw the sequence ðŸŸ© ðŸŸ¨ â¬œ â¬œ â¬œ. 

To find the next guess, you could enter in the command `python wordle_solver --board "crane" "GYXXX"`, which would produce the following output.
