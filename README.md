## Wordle Solver

This codebase helps you make intelligent guesses when playing wordle, using ideas from information theory! 

### Installation

Clone this repository and run `conda env create -f env.yml` to create the conda environment. Then run `conda activate wordle`. 

### User Guide

The main program in this codebase is `wordle_solver.py`. This program helps you make intelligent guesses,
and comes with the followig arguments. 

- `--board`: this argument allows you to enter the current state of your game as a sequence of guesses and outputs. The default sequence is empty, assuming you're starting without a guess, but it can be as many pairs of guesses and outputs you've already played. To enter an output, please use the following convention: 

  ðŸŸ© = `"G"`, ðŸŸ¨ = `"Y"`, and â¬œ = `"X"`. 

  For example, if you guessed "crane" and saw â¬œ â¬œ ðŸŸ© â¬œ ðŸŸ©, and then "cloud" and saw â¬œ ðŸŸ© â¬œ â¬œ ðŸŸ¨, you'd enter `--board "crane" "XXGXG" "cloud" "XGXXY"`. 

- `--data_dir`: this argument specifies the location of `wordle_words.txt` a list of valid wordle words. The default directory is `data`. This directory will also store `starting_guesses.csv`, an precomputed list of guesses ranked by their expected information.

This program will provide next guess suggestions from two strategies: `best_guess` and `best_answer`. `best_guess` suggests the word with the highest expected information, while `best_answer` suggests the word with the highest expected information that is also a potential answer. In general, `best_guess` is a more cautious strategy that focuses on narrowing down possibilities at the expense of quick wins, while `best_answer` trades some informational gain for the chance to get a lucky match. The performance of these two strategies is evaluated using `strategy_simulator.py`. For more details, please see the `design_document.pdf`. 

### Examples

Let's say that you guessed "crane" and saw the sequence ðŸŸ© ðŸŸ¨ â¬œ â¬œ â¬œ. 

To find the next guess, you could enter in the command `python wordle_solver --board "crane" "GYXXX"`, which would produce the following output. 

```
There are 9 possible answers remaining.

Using the strategy: best_guess, we suggest picking one of: 
ivory  viola  lorry  glory


Using the strategy: best_answer, we suggest picking one of: 
court
```

### Performance

We can benchmark our performance using `strategy_simulations.py`. Both of our strategy variants can reliably solve wordles within 3-4 guesses, beating out my personal performance and reference baselines. For more details, please see the `design_document.pdf`.
